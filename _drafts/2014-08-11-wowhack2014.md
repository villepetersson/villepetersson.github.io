Now that both #wowhack2014 and the Way Out West festival is over, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Spotify for stepping up and keeping this tradition alive. There were quite some cool hacks this year and I'm really happy about the one that I and @davidnaas did: *The Chucklers*.

We decided early on that we wanted to do something musical and low-level - not a finished product - and in lagom time for the event found the language ChucK. Chuck is an academic programming language which touts being "statically timed", rather than just statically typed. What this actually means is that you have complete control over timing: instead of iterating over processor ticks, you can iterate over specific durations, in a multi-threaded manner. This is done by piping (or chucking, as it's called) durations into the magic "now" object:


	// Set the beats per minute
	120 => float bpm;

	// Calculate the number of seconds per beat
	(60.0/bpm) => float secondsPerBeat;

	// Save this duration
	1::second * secondsPerBeat => dur duration;


	while(true) {

		// Debug print hello world

		<<< "Hello world!" >>>

		// Advance time
		duration => now;	
	}


*The above code will print Hello world in a timely 120bpm manner.*
