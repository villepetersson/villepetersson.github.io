## Hello.

I'm a software engineer currently residing in Gothenburg, Sweden, where I'm studying for a Civil Engineering degree in Software Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology. At the moment I'm working on a startup in the nightlife space and consulting iOS applications. To see in more detail what I do, check the project pages on the side.

This is my personal homepage, which currently acts as a portfolio, and some time in the future might act as a blog.

If you want to contact me, I recommend using villepetersson@gmail.com
