As lone iOS developer at [Ancon AB](ancon.se), a small company in the POS business, I created a mobile extension to our POS system for restaurants, running on iPad and iPhone. 

Ancon Guest App helps the staff take orders, split payments between different customers at the same table, and printing checks. This is done with deep integration to their current POS system. It also has features such as showing a graphical map of the tables at the restaurant, giving descriptions of dishes and ability to handle dishes with any number of extras and changes.

This was my first professional programming gig, and I gained huge amounts of experience with developing big, complex iOS applications and interfering with critical legacy money-handling systems. 

The app I developed is today used daily at several restaurants around Sweden.
